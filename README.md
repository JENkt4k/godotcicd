## Why This Action?

Most existing Godot CI/CD solutions focus solely on Linux builds and require complex workflow YAML configurations. This action aims to provide:

1. First-class Windows build support
2. User-friendly configuration interface
3. Simplified setup process
4. Better error handling and feedback

## Development Status

🚧 This project is currently in development. Features and documentation will be updated regularly.
